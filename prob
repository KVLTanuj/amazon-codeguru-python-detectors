Make changes in your feature-branch. This could be modifying existing files, adding new files, or deleting files.
Commit these changes to the feature-branch.
Push the changes to GitHub.

Once you've made changes to the feature-branch that differ from the main branch, you should be able to create a pull request.
If you're using this repository for demonstration purposes and don't actually need to make real changes, you could:

Create a dummy file in the feature-branch.
Commit and push this change.
Then try to create the pull request again.

This should give you the difference needed between the branches to successfully create a pull request.
